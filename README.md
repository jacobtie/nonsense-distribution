# Nonsense Distribution

While the application is running, a random block is selected and then is either increased or decreased by a number from 1 to 10. The affected block then sorts itself within the list to bubble to the correct position. 

This application serves no purpose. It came to me during a nap and was only implemented due to the boredom of quarantine.
